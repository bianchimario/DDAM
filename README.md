Distributed Data Analysis and Mining - Spark (Hadoop)

Analysis of the dataset *Australia, Rain Tomorrow.*

Tasks:
1. Data Understanding
2. Data Preparation
3. Classification and Clustering
4. Regression

About the course: "this course aims at teaching the basic theoretical concepts behind the MapReduce distributed computing paradigm, and Hadoop in particular, and at building expertise in the practical usage of high-performance computing tools for data engineering, analysis and mining. In particular, the students will learn how classical data mining algorithms can be applied to Big Data using **Hadoop (Spark)**. Real (and open source) datasets will be used to present examples and to let the students build their own projects".
